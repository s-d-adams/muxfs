conf	Configuration.
d	Destination; typically the target 'dev' for a write operation.
desc	Descriptor, relating to file descriptors; more specifically a

	of the file content.  Metadata checksums are produced from these
	descriptions.
dev	Device; not a block device but a directory used internally by muxfs to
	store persistent data.  Muxfs mirrors data across an array of 'dev's.
dind	Device index; ranging from zero to the number of 'dev's minus one.
	Also used as the type for counting 'dev's.
ds	Dynamic stack.  Read ds.h for more information.
eno	An "external" inode number, exposed to through FUSE to the user via
	stat(2).  See also 'use_ino' in fuse_new(3).
ent	Entry; as in directory entry.
gen	Generate.  Read gen.c for more information.
ino	An "internal" inode number specific to one 'dev', hidden from the user.
