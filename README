The Multiplexed Filesystem  
==========================

IMPORTANT
---------
DO NOT USE MUXFS YET.  MUXFS IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT READY FOR
PRODUCTION USE.  IF AND WHEN MUXFS BECOMES STABLE IT WILL BE INTENDED FOR
LONG-TERM DATA STORAGE, HOWEVER USING MUXFS IN ITS CURRENT FORM WILL LIKELY
LEAD TO LOSS OF DATA.

Introduction
------------
muxfs is an experimental mirroring and checksumming filesystem layer for
OpenBSD.  It mirrors the filesystem tree at the mount point to a series of
user-selected directories, and employs a checksum database to validate and
restore files in realtime.

Installation
------------
	# make
	# make install

Usage
-----
1. Create a directory array.  With empty, non-overlapping directories:
	# newfs_muxfs -d /path/to/dir/1 -d /path/to/dir/2 ...
2. Mount the array.
	# mount_muxfs /path/to/dir/1 /path/to/dir/2 ... /path/to/mount/point
3. Edit the tree at the mount point.
4. Unmount the array.
	# umount /path/to/mount/point

Recommendations
---------------
* Use root directories of freshly formatted filesystems as the directories in
  the array in order to minimize the size of the checksum databases.

If you want to read the code then I advise that you first look at GLOSSARY,
then muxfs.h, then progress to the rest of the code.  If you want to test a
patch then I advise that you edit Makefile commenting out the 'unity' target
and uncommenting the 'incremental' target; this may increase build time and
binary size but will produce clearer compiler error messages.  To run
mount_muxfs under a debugger you will need to uncomment either the '-f' line or
the '-odebug' line from mount_muxfs.c (see fuse_parse_cmdline(3) for details).
